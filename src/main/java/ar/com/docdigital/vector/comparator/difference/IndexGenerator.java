/**
 * Comparison between VectorImageGridIntersections grid lines has two outcomes,
 * on one hand there are distances, when intersections on each grid form pairs, 
 * on the other hand we have a percentage of intersections that didn't find pair
 * called lostPoints in IntersectionsDifference, the implementations of this 
 * Interfaces should find a formula to integrate both in a unique index. 
 * 
 * Consider that:
 * Given a pair of grids with 100% of lost points, the distance will be 0, as 
 * there was no matching pair of intersections.
